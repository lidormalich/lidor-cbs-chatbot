## Run with google dialogflow
To use the chatbot application, simply send the command `news` to initiate it. Note that during the initial setup, it may take up to 10 minutes for the server to wake up. If you receive an `[empty response]` message, please wait for 10 minutes and then try again by sending a message to the chatbot.
